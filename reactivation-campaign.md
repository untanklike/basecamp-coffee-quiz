**Subject:** What's your coffee personality type?

**Body:**

Hey there!

Your baristas have been wondering something: what's your coffee style?

Are you the type who wants something bold and a little unexpected? Or are you happiest with a perfectly made classic, every single time? Maybe you're somewhere in between — and haven't quite found your drink yet.

We built a 90-second quiz that figures it out. Answer a few questions, get your coffee personality type, and walk into your local Basecamp knowing exactly what to ask for next time.

It's genuinely fun. And your result might surprise you.

Find out who you are: coffee-quiz-basecamp.vercel.app

📸 Got your result? Screenshot it and share to Instagram Stories — tag us @basecampcoffee

See you soon,
The Basecamp Coffee community

## Notes

- Do not mention points, tiers, or loyalty mechanics — this is a discovery moment
- Fix push notification timing before sending (members previously received 6am pings)
- Stagger the send if platform allows — 10k simultaneous visits may strain free tier
