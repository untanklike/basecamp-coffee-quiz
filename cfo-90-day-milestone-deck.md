# Basecamp Rewards — 90-Day Turnaround
## CFO Milestone Deck | February 28, 2026 (Day 60)

---

## 1. Where We Started

The program was losing money and accelerating toward negative ROI.

| Metric | Baseline | vs. Target |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Monthly active users | 2,100 | 26% of 8,000 target |
| 30-day retention | 31% | 52% of 60% target |
| Avg visits/month | 2.3 | 58% of 4.0 target |
| Redemption rate | 18% | 45% of 40% target |
| Program ROI | 0.5 | Was 1.8 eighteen months ago |

**What was failing and why:**

- 12,400 total sign-ups, but only 2,100 active — a 83% drop-off rate
- 89% of members permanently stuck at Trailblazer (lowest tier); tier system generated zero incremental behavior
- App engagement down 67% over 6 months
- Cost per member doubled; lifetime value halved
- 10 campaigns over 12 months — all variations of "more points" — none changed baseline behavior
- Proof point: Valentine's Day drove +23% scan lift, collapsed to baseline the next day

**Root cause (confirmed by all internal stakeholders):** The program had no identity. Members used the app to track a number, not to engage with Basecamp. Customers literally said: *"Your coffee has personality. Your rewards program doesn't."*

## 2. What We Did

We stopped running discount campaigns and replaced the program's front door.

**The solution: Coffee Personality Quiz** — live at `coffee-quiz-basecamp.vercel.app`

Instead of greeting new members with a zero-point balance, every member now enters through a 90-second personality quiz that identifies their coffee type (Bold Adventurer, Cozy Classic, Sweet Enthusiast, The Savorer) and delivers a personalized first recommendation.

**Why this is different from the previous 10 campaigns:**

| Previous Campaigns | Personality Quiz Approach |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Offered more of the same (points) | Offers identity and recognition |
| Transactional by design | Relational by design |
| Engagement spikes, no baseline change | Builds a reason to return |
| Not shareable | Quiz result is shareable content |
| Required spend to unlock value | Delivers value at sign-up, before first purchase |

**What differentiates this in the market:** Dutch Bros wins on belonging. Starbucks wins on gamification. No regional competitor has a personality-based loyalty layer. This is an uncontested space.

**Operational proof:** Baristas can explain it in one sentence: "Take this quick quiz — it figures out your coffee style and then we can actually make recommendations for you." Previous program could not pass that test.

## 3. 30/60/90 Day Milestones

We committed to measurable checkpoints, not outcomes at the end of 90 days.

| Milestone | Target | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Day 30 — Month 1 check** | 3,500 MAU, 40% retention | Pending (due ~March 1) |
| **Day 60 — Pilot launch** | Quiz live at 5–10 locations | COMPLETE (today) |
| **Day 60 — Reactivation ready** | Email to 10,300 dormant members | READY TO SEND |
| **Day 90 — Full rollout decision** | 8,000 MAU, 60% retention | Go/no-go at day 60 data |

**Failure definition (agreed in advance):** If Day 30 shows fewer than 3,000 MAU and retention below 35%, escalate to Dana immediately. No drift. Stop/pivot decision by Day 45.

**What happens next (Day 60–90):**
- Deploy reactivation campaign to 10,300 dormant members (cost: $0 — uses existing email infrastructure)
- Collect pilot location data (quiz completion rate, repeat visit rate, redemption rate)
- Go/no-go decision for full 45-location rollout based on pilot results

## 4. Dollar-Value Translation

Every metric improvement has a direct revenue equivalent.

### Assumption Set

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Average transaction value | $7.50 |
| Baseline monthly visits per active user | 2.3 |
| Baseline MAU | 2,100 |
| Baseline monthly revenue (program members) | 2,100 × 2.3 × $7.50 = **$36,225/month** |

---

### Scenario A: Hit Month 1 Targets (Minimum Bar)

| Change | Calculation | Monthly Revenue Impact |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| MAU: 2,100 → 3,500 | +1,400 users | — |
| Visits: 2.3 → 2.8/month | +0.5 visits/user | — |
| Combined | 3,500 × 2.8 × $7.50 | **$73,500/month** |
| **vs. Baseline** | | **+$37,275/month (+103%)** |

Annualized: **+$447,300/year** from loyalty member segment alone.

---

### Scenario B: Hit 90-Day Targets (Full Program Goal)

| Change | Calculation | Monthly Revenue Impact |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| MAU: 2,100 → 8,000 | +5,900 users | — |
| Visits: 2.3 → 4.0/month | +1.7 visits/user | — |
| Combined | 8,000 × 4.0 × $7.50 | **$240,000/month** |
| **vs. Baseline** | | **+$203,775/month (+563%)** |

Annualized: **+$2,445,300/year** from loyalty member segment.

### ROI Restoration

| Scenario | Monthly Revenue | Program Cost (est.) | ROI |
|----------|----------------|---------------------|-----|
| Baseline | $36,225 | ~$36,000 (at 0.5x) | 0.5 |
| Month 1 targets | $73,500 | ~$36,000 | ~2.0 |
| 90-day targets | $240,000 | ~$36,000 | ~6.7 |

Getting to Month 1 targets alone restores ROI above the program's historical high of 1.8. Full 90-day targets represent a 13x improvement over current ROI.

---

### Dormant Member Reactivation Value

10,300 dormant members represent recoverable revenue at zero additional acquisition cost.

| Assumption | Value |
|------------|-------|
| Reactivation rate (conservative 10%) | 1,030 members |
| Visits/month at reactivated baseline (2.0) | 2,060 visits |
| Revenue at $7.50/visit | **$15,450/month** |
| Cost of reactivation campaign | **$0** |

Even a 5% reactivation rate adds **$7,725/month** at no incremental cost. This campaign goes out this week.

## 5. The Ask

We are at the decision point. The pilot proves the concept; full rollout requires a go decision.

**What we need to complete the 45-location rollout:**

| Item | Status | Requirement |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Quiz infrastructure (built, live) | Complete | No additional spend |
| Pilot location data (Day 60–75) | In progress | 2 weeks |
| Dev capacity for full rollout | To confirm | Written confirmation from dev team |
| POS item-level data validation | To confirm | Required before enabling discovery challenges |
| Push notification audit | Required | Fix bad timing before full launch |
| Full rollout authorization | **Pending CFO** | Go/no-go by March 15 |

**The ask in plain terms:** Authorize the 45-location rollout by March 15 based on pilot data. No additional budget required — the quiz is built, the reactivation campaign costs nothing, and the program runs on existing infrastructure.

**The cost of waiting:** Every week at baseline costs approximately $9,056 in foregone monthly revenue versus Month 1 targets. Delay is not a neutral choice.

**Stop condition:** If pilot data does not show at least 3,000 MAU and 35% retention by Day 75, we halt full rollout and bring a revised plan to Dana within one week.
